# Weather-Report-Histogram

This project will familiarize you with try-catch constructs in Java and graphics programming using JavaFX. The given task was to write a program in Java to display histograms (bar graphs). The program reads monthly rainfall data for multiple years from a file, computes the monthly average rainfall for all those years, and displays a histogram of the monthly averages over all the years, alongside the histogram for the last year of recorded rainfall.
